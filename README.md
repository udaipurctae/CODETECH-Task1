Overview of the Projects:

Project 1: Comparison of different AI models
This task is carried out by analysing and comparing outputs produced by four different algorithms namely:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Random Forest

and by using various evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC).
These models provide a detailed analysis of  False positive cancer detection .
The results are visualized to facilitate comparison and interpretation of model performance.
